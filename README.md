# tic-tac-toe
Tic-Tac-Toe is a game that has been enjoyed by people of all ages for many years. It is a classic two-player game in which each player takes turns placing their icons (either an "X" or an "O") on a 3x3 grid. The goal of the game is to get three of your icons in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) before your opponent does.
